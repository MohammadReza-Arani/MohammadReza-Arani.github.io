[//]: <> (Iâ€™m a graduate student at the University of Tehran, studying the Electrical Engineering Master program majoring in Field and Wave. I received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Tehran in 2021. Due to my hard work, I was able to be listed among the brilliant talent quota to register for the master's program without taking the Master's Entrance Exam and study my favorite major in the master's program. I have tried many different technologies and studied many concepts from Machine Learning and Neural Networks to Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning, but my strongly formed math basis helped me through difficulties and saved me a lot of time and effort to tackle different projects and assignments. )

I am a graduate student at the <a href="https://ut.ac.ir/en">University of Tehran</a>, studying the Electrical Engineering master program majoring in **Field and wave**. I received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the <a href="https://ut.ac.ir/en">University of Tehran</a> in 2021 with a brilliant talent quota, which means I was able to register for the master's program without taking the Master's Entrance Exam based on my ranking in the undergraduate program. I am passionate about learning new technologies and concepts, especially those that involve **complex mathematics**. I have a strong foundation in mathematics, which allows me to understand and apply these technologies in creative and innovative ways.
</div>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
I am particularly interested in **optimization**, **machine learning**, **neural networks**, **quantum computing**, and **quantum machine learning**. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize many industries and solve some of the world's most challenging problems. I am excited to be a part of this revolution and to use these technologies to make a positive impact on the world.

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
One of the most important tasks of any researcher is to apply available tools and methods in our enriched engineering literature to address today's world's issues in different areas from transportation (Autonomous Vehicles) to Wireless Communication (Development of 5G and 6G Tech.) and social media management (including recommender systems) to Medical areas where we can restore disabled's will and power to live normally.
</div>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
I believe that most problems can be solved if we are willing to look at them from a different angle. I find it a great pleasure to use my mathematical skills to solve complex problems, especially those that involve modeling high-dimensional problems with matrix notations and taking advantage of convex optimization to find optimal solutions. I am confident that my skills and interests make me a valuable asset to any team. I believe in **hard deep work** which gives me the power to **learn new things fast**. I am also a **team player** and willing to help others.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing ping pong, hiking, and spending time with my family and friends.

[//]: <> (I am passionate about learning new technologies and concepts, and I have a strong foundation in mathematics. I am particularly interested in new technologies and concepts including machine learning, neural networks, quantum computing, and quantum machine learning. It is a great joy to use these technologies to address issues faced by classical methods previously applied to solve problems. Most of our problems could be solved when looked at from a different angle. I enjoy handling high-dimensional problems with matrix notations and modeling whether in FDTD or Convex Optimization. .)
